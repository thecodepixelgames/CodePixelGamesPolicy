            <p>The Services may use cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects and web

                information. A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a
                user’s computer. Cookies do not include people’s names, email addresses, or other information that is
                personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user’s computer and to
                “remember” things about the user’s visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you
                when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online and
                login.</p>

            <p>CodePixelGames may use your Personal Information to send you messages about our company or our features,
                products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when
                necessary, unless you have not consented to allow CodePixelGames to use your data.</p>

            <p>CodePixelGames also may use your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, both individually or
                combined together, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for
                statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for customer
                support and technical support, to manage and provide the Services, and to customize content and layout
                of the Services.</p>

            <p>Names, postal and e-mail addresses and phone numbers collected may be added to our databases and used
                for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and
                the status of orders placed online.</p>

            <p>CodePixelGames does not sell or rent your Personal Information to third-parties for marketing purposes
                without your consent. CodePixelGames may share your Personal Information you provide with CodePixelGames

                that assist CodePixelGames in providing you services. CodePixelGames is committed to giving you the
                choice whether or not CodePixelGames uses your information for marketing purposes or shares information
                with business partners.</p>

            <h2>Collection And Use Of Children’s Personal Information:</h2>

            <p>The Services comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). CodePixelGames does not
                knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. In
                addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within
                the Services or in connection with any Content or Software, CodePixelGames will not collect, store or
                use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that CodePixelGames receives personal
                information that CodePixelGames discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, CodePixelGames
                will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.</p>

                Personal information collected by CodePixelGames is stored in secure operating environments that are not
                available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. In addition, our online
                store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial
                information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the
                loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality). Before
                we allow web users to access their personal information, for example, we verify their identity by
                requesting that they submit information such as their username and password. We also take reasonable
                steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer personal information provide sufficient
                protection of such data.</p>

            <h2>Links To Third Party Sites Or Services:</h2>

            <p>You should be aware that the Services may from time to time contain links to third-party sites, products
                or services. CodePixelGames is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites
                or services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we recommend that
                you read the privacy policy of the site or service to which you link before you submit any personal
                information.</p>

            <h2>Access To Personal Information:</h2>
